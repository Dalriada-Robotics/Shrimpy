Shrimpy
=======

A Open-source cheap educational robot powered by the Raspberry Pi
The shrimpy is based on the open source shrimpbot http://geekmoore.wordpress.com/

The solid works files are included for the 2 parts and also a DXF ready to cut with a laser cutter.

The robot was designed to be held together with blue tack or tape.

I have personally built the shrimpy with
Wheels - http://goo.gl/f8DB8
Motor controller - http://goo.gl/dbDhg
Ultrasonic distance sensor - http://goo.gl/g498G
Motors - http://goo.gl/BQQdJ
UBEC - http://goo.gl/Dg9CF
The UBEC with a little soldering and the end of a micro USB cable to allow you to power the pi from 6 AA batteries.

Those are just some ideas for items, you are likely to find them cheaper ones if you shop around.

I have included some example python code for object avoidance and some example scratch programs for remote control.
